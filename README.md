# Subarray_Odyssey
# 1/20/2024

🚀 Get ready to embark on an exhilarating journey through the realms of algorithmic challenges! Presenting the Maximum Subarray Odyssey - a quest that beckons you to harness the raw power of numbers and unravel the secrets of optimal efficiency. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate through a tumultuous sea of integers and discover a contiguous subarray that holds the treasure of the Largest Sum. But that's not all - your true prowess will be tested as you're tasked not only with finding the golden sum but also with pinpointing the exact boundaries of this legendary subarray, marking the starting and ending indices of your rich find.

Your weapons? Your wit, your knack for efficiency, and your coding skills. Sharpen your algorithms and brace yourself for an adventure where time complexity is your stealthy speed and space complexity your armor. Dive into this odyssey, emerge with the optimal solution, and etch your name in the annals of coding legendry! May the code be with you! 🌟✨


🚀 Challenge Constraints
Array Size: The input array may contain up to 10^6 integers.
Number Range: The integers in the input array will range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
Non-Empty Subarray: Every valid input array will contain at least one integer.

📤 Submission Guidelines
Fork the Repository: Begin by forking the challenge repository. This will be your personal staging ground for greatness.
Code Your Solution: In your chosen high-performance language. Remember, efficiency is key!
Naming Convention: Name your solution file using the following convention: <your_name>_solution.* (replace <your_name> with your actual name and * with the appropriate file extension for your language).
Merge Request: Once you're confident in your epic solution, submit it by creating a merge request to the original repository. Make sure your merge request title is clear and descriptive.

🏆 Winner Selection Criteria
Correctness: Solutions must pass all provided test cases, proving their ability to handle a wide range of input scenarios effectively.
Performance: Among the correct solutions, the crown will go to the one with the fastest execution time. Prepare to push the limits of efficiency!
Code Elegance (Tiebreaker): In the event of a tie in execution time, the solution with the fewer lines of code will be deemed superior, reflecting not only raw speed but also the elegance and readability of the code.

🕒 Submission Deadline
All merge requests must be submitted by Sunday night at midnight.
